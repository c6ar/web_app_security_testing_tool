<h1>Settings help</h1>
<h2>General settings</h2>
<p><i>Changing settings described below requires manual app restart to apply them.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme</b> (default <i>System</i>) - a general theme of the WASTT's appearance. It currently supported theme of the app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>System</li>
  <li>Dark</li>
  <li>Light</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Language</b> (default <i>English</i>) - currently supported languages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>German</li>
  <li>Polish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proxy settings</h2>
<p><i>Settings described here involve proxy process restart for changes to apply.</i></p>
<p><b>Address & port</b> (default <i>localhost:8082</i>) - IP address or hostname with the port on which mitmdump proxy should run.
    The same settings are applied to built-in browser.</p>
<p><b>Reload proxy</b> - In case of emergency, there is an option to reload proxy without closing the app
    with ongoing testing project. It has additional option to retain the current Web Request Interceptor's
    scope while reloading the proxy.</p>
<p><b>Proxy logging</b> (default <i>OFF</i>) - Posibility to log process of mitmdump and WASTT's custom proxy script if needed.
After enabling this option, the log files titled <code><i>proxy-DATE.log</i></code> and
    <code><i>mitmdump-DATE.log</i></code> are saved to default log files location.</p>
<p><b>Proxy terminal</b> (default <i>OFF</i>) - Option to open mitmdump proxy process in a new command line shell. If enabled,
    output from the proxy script will be displayed in the new terminal window and not in the standard python
    output to the console.<br>Due to app's current limitations, killing proxy process only terminates process in the terminal window, and not the
    terminal window itself.</p>
<h2>Browser settings</h2>
<p><i>Settings described here involve web browser process restart for changes to apply.</i></p>
<p><b>Browser types </b> (default <i>Chrome</i>) - there are currently three supported variants of built-in browser to run.
Availability of each of these variants depends depends on their respective binary being already installed in the system.<br>
Currently supported variants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Disable infobars and notifications</b> (default <i>ON</i>) - an option to disable all infobars, notices and notificatinos
    within the browser. There might be pop-ups informing about testing purposees of the built-in Selenium web driver browser.
    It is recommended to disable them for clearer visibility of pages and better
    acessibility during testing processes.</p>
<p><b>Disable certificate errors</b> (default <i>ON</i>) - an option to fully disable missing certificate error and warnings in case
of missing certificates on the web-pages. Disabling these warnings allow to directly open HTTPs pages.</p>
<h2>Logs settings</h2>

    Web Request Interceptor while it is turned on.</p>
<h2>Debug settings</h2>
<p><i>These settings are purely for testing and debugging purposes. Having them on and using during normal testing,
may cause unwanted behaviour of the app and fail testing process.</i></p>
