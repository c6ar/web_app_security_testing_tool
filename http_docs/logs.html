<h1>WASTT | Logs module</h1>
<p>
    This module is responsible for the graphical and organizational display of logs, which facilitates you in
    tracking activities and saving diagnostic data. This allows you to have an organized view of the data
    concerning saved HTTP traffic, the operation of the Web Interceptor, Intruder modules, and Repeater - which can
    be helpful in debugging and analyzing application actions.
</p>
<p>
    The view of this module is divided into 4 widgets, each responsible for separately tracking different types of
    logs for "HTTP Traffic", "Request Interceptor", "Intruder", and "Repeater". Each widget provides access to the
    most recently saved log and the folder of those logs.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, in the top right corner of the interface of this module, there is a button that allows opening
    the main logs location - which can be changed in the program settings. There is also a button in this interface
    to open this documentation for the application module.
