<h1>WASTT | Repeater module</h1>
<p>
    This tool is designed to allow users to craft, modify, and re-send HTTP requests
    to a target server, making it useful for testing and debugging HTTP interactions.
</p>
<p>
    Repeater allows you to send a personalized request and receive a response to it.
    Each iteration of sending the request is saved along with the response in Repeater for later comparative analysis.
</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>
    The user can add up to 20 separate, independent Repeater tabs. Each of these tabs operates independently and allows the user to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter the host address to which the request should be sent;</li>
    <li>Use an editable request text field, where the user can personalize the content of the request
        in the form of an HTTP message;</li>
    <li>View a non-editable response text field, where the response to the request is displayed in text form,
        with a button in the top right corner that allows the response to be viewed as a browser render;</li>
    <li>Use the send request button – pressing the button sends the request;</li>
    <li>Access a dropdown menu with the chronology of each request's iterations and its responses;</li>
    <li>Use an information button that opens the internal user documentation for this module of the application.</li>
