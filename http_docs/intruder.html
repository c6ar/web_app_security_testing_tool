<h1>WASTT | Intruder module</h1>
<p>
    Intruder module provides a user interface for configuring and executing three different types of attack.
    It is designed to facilitate the user’s interaction with payload-based attacks
    by offering visual elements to configure requests, manage payloads, execute attacks, and monitor the results.
</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>
    The user can add up to 10 tabs to conduct and manage attacks simultaneously. In each Intruder tab, the user can.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the type of attack from the dropdown menu in the top bar of the tab,</li>
    <li>Set positions in the request where the words from the provided payload should be placed during the attack,</li>
    <li>Provide the address of the service, application, or website (Target),</li>
    <li>Add payloads, one payload per line, with the option to load text files and quickly clear the list,</li>
    <li>Start the attack, retry the attack, and display the attack results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attack types</h2>
<p>
    Intruder allows for following attack types:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sniper attack - it uses a single set of payloads and one or more payload positions.
        It places each payload in the first position, then each payload in the second position, and so on.</li>
    <li>Batterin ram attack - it uses a single set of payloads. It iterates through the user-provided
        payloads and places the same payload in all defined positions in the request simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Pitchfork attack - it uses multiple sets of payloads, each for defined position.
        The attack iterates through all sets of payloads simultaneously, using first the first payload from each set,
        then the second payload from each set, and so on. The attack ends after using the last payload from the shortest
        of the provided payload lists.</li>
</ul>
