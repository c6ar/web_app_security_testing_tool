    <title>WASTT | Proxy Module Help</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>WASTT | Proxy Module</h1>
<p>
    The main module of the application is the Proxy server, which enables the operation of two submodules — HTTP Traffic
    and Web Request Interceptor. The Proxy server uses the mitmdump library. Mitmdump is launched as a subprocess of the
    application and, by default, operates on port 8082 of the localhost address.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    In the application settings, it is possible to change the address and port on which the proxy server is to be
    launched, as well as the option to open the process in a separate terminal window where all output
    information is displayed instead of the console in which the application is launched.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Additionally, proxy server can be restarted from app settings level without need of restarting WASTT app itself.
</p>
<h2>HTTP Traffic</h2>
<p>
    Each request made through the running mitmdump proxy from both the built-in web browser and from any browser that uses
    a proxy connection to the running mitmdump proxy will be added to the HTTP Traffic list on this page.
</p>
<p>
    When selecting any request from the list, a bottom pane appears with the contents of the selected request and its
    response.
    <br>
    The selected request can be modified in the textbox and sent as is to the intruder and repeater module.
    <br>
    Multiple requests can be selected, and their respective host domains and subdomains can be added and removed from
    the scope, either by using a button above the list or from a right-click context menu.
</p>
<p>
    The list can be sorted by the values of each column alphabetically.
    <br><br>
    If there are host domains and/or subdomains added to the scope, the HTTP Traffic list can also be filtered to include
    only items from the scope using the "Filter with scope" button above the request list.
</p>
<h2>Web Request Interceptor</h2>
<p>
    The Web Request Interceptor can be turned on or off at any time. When it is on, it intercepts web requests made through
    the running proxy on the specified address and port—by default, <i>localhost:8082</i>.
    The Web Request Interceptor intercepts requests to domains or their respective subdomains if these are included in
    the scope. Flows with requests to other domains are resumed during intercepting. If the scope is empty, all requests are
    intercepted.
</p>
<p>
    Each intercepted request can be inspected and edited. It can be forwarded to resume the intercepted flow or dropped,
    which results in finalizing the current web flow made from a specific tab in the browser.
</p>
<p>
    If the Web Request Interceptor is turned off while having any request intercepted, a dialog will appear asking
    to decide on further action—whether to forward the intercepted request as it is in the edited textbox or to forward the
    original request.
